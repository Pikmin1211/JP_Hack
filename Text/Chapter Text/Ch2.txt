[Right][LoadSanders][FarRight][LoadArden][MidLeft][LoadOldMan]
Ah, greetings, young ones.[AN]
What brings you[N]
to our humble temple?[AN]

[Right]
I'm afraid it's not[N]
good news, Father.[AN]
We have reason to believe the[N]
imperial army may be coming here.[AN]
Not for a friendly visit, either.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh? But whatever[N]
would it be for?[AN]

[FarRight]
You wouldn't happen to know about[N]
some kind of holy weapon, wouldja?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmm... I see. I'm[N]
afraid I don't.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadMarisa]
Oh, darn! I was[N]
hoping to see it...[AN]

[FarRight]
What's more important[N]
is these people's safety.[AN]
Whether or not that's true,[N]
I doubt they'll believe you.[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadVillagerMan]
Father! It's urgent![N]
There's a commotion outside...[A][X]



## Ch2OP2
[Left][LoadBatta][FarLeft][LoadONeill]
Alright, you lot![AN]
We know you gots that[N]
magicy sword in there![AN]
If ya give it here, we'll[N]
only kill most of yas![AN]
Gahaha![AN]

[MidRight][LoadSanders]
Bandits? Not exactly[N]
who I was expecting...[AN]
But I'll cut you[N]
down all the same![AN]

[Left]
Huh? You again?![AN]
Grrrargh! This time,[N]
I'll really do you in![AN]
Prepare to die, redhead![AN]
Nobody makes a fool outta[N]
Batta's Beasts and lives![A][X]




## Ch2OP3
[MidRight][LoadOldMan]
Oh dear,[N]
this is bad...[AN]

[Left][LoadWolt][FarLeft][LoadScott]
Stay inside, Father.[AN]
Allow us to defend[N]
you and the priory.[AN]

[Left]
We'll keep[N]
you safe![AN]

[MidRight]
You are too kind...[AN]
Alright, everyone,[N]
keep safe inside.[AN]
Don't move an inch![A][X]



## Ch2PostPrep1
[MidRight][LoadSanders]
Looks like the priests[N]
are going to stay inside.[AN]
Let's make sure no stragglers[N]
sneak inside and attack them.[A][X]

## Ch2PostPrep2
[MidRight][LoadSanders]
Those two goons seem[N]
to be calling the shots.[AN]
Maybe if I take them out...[A][X]



## Ch2Ending
[FarLeft][LoadWrys][Right][LoadSanders][FarRight][LoadScott][Left][LoadOldMan]
Thank you for[N]
protecting us.[AN]
Were it not for you,[AN]
well, we'd be closer[N]
to God than we'd like.[AN]

[FarRight]
Our duty is to protect![N]
Think nothing of it.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Father, they are[N]
trustworthy young ones.[AN]
I think we can tell them.[AN]

[Left]
...Yes, I think so, Brother Wrys.[AN]
I do know of a holy weapon. Many,[N]
in fact. There are twelve in total.[AN]
Used by the heroes of legend to[N]
defeat the Demon King, long ago.[AN]
There used to be one of[N]
those weapons housed here,[AN]
but it was relocated to a[N]
forest nearby for safekeeping.[AN]

[Right]
I see. But why does[N]
that concern us?[AN]

[Left]
Ohoho! I think your destiny is[N]
greater than you believe it to be.[AN]

[Right]
[Beat][AN]

[FarRight]
In any case, if the imperials are[N]
going to be looking for them,[AN]
we may want to get to them first.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadMarisa]
Plus, I want to see them![N]
They sound super cool![AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadFinn]
With that kind of weapon,[N]
you could do terrible things.[AN]
Let's not think of them as toys.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Please, allow me to[N]
accompany them, Father.[AN]
I know the path to the[N]
weapon through the woods.[AN]

[Left]
Are you certain? They are[N]
teeming with monsters.[AN]
It will be a perilous task.[N]
I cannot guarentee your safety.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadSanders]
You've seen us handle ourselves.[N]
I think we can manage fine.[AN]

[Left]
...Yes, I suppose you're right.[AN]
Very well then! I bid you good luck.[N]
May God watch over you all.[A][X]



## Ch2ItemGet
[MidRight][LoadSanders]
Hm? What's this?[AN]
Seems those bandits dropped[N]
it when they scurried off...[A][X]




## Ch2Wrys
[MidRight][LoadWrys]
Oh dear, what[N]
is going on?[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadArden]
Ah, Father Wrys. Would you be[N]
able to lend a hand here?[AN]

[MidRight]
But of course. Come[N]
to me if you get hurt.[A][X]



## Ch2BattaBattle
[MidLeft][LoadBatta]
I'll make you pay[N]
for messin' with me![A][X]

## Ch2BattaDeath
[MidLeft][LoadBatta]
Gaaah! Again?![N]
Damn you...![A][X]

## Ch2ONeillBattle
[MidLeft][LoadONeill]
Think you're tough[N]
enough to handle me?[AN]
Don't make me laugh![A][X]

## Ch2ONeillDeath
[MidLeft][LoadONeill]
Urg... that was just...[N]
Beginner's luck![AN]
Don't think I'll be going[N]
easy on you next time, huh?![A][X]

## Ch2PriestDeath
[MidRight][LoadSanders]
Damn... we weren't[N]
able to save them...[A][X]
