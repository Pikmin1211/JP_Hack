Seems we finally[N]
made it here.[AN]

[FarRight]
Ehh? But there's[N]
nobody around...[AN]

[Right]
This gives me[N]
a bad feeling.[AN]
Did something happen?[AN]

[FarRight]
Oh, here[N]
comes someone.[AN]
Heeey! Mister![AN]

[MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadVillagerMan]
Huh? What do you want?[N]
I'm in a bit of a hurry...[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadFinn]
What exactly is[N]
going on around here?[AN]

[FarLeft]
You haven't heard?[AN]
Those beasts are[N]
coming around![AN]
If we don't run[N]
away quick,[AN]
they'll tear us[N]
to shreds...[AN]
Now, if you'll[N]
excuse me,[AN]
I have to go.[AN]

[Clear][LoadSayori]
Beasts? You don't[N]
think he means...[AN]

[Left]
There's only one bunch[N]
of beasts we know.[AN]

[Right]
Looks like we've[N]
got another job.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadNeptune]
Aw, can't I catch a[N]
break around here...?[A][X]



## Ch5OP2
[Right][LoadMoneyman][FarRight][LoadLoli][MidLeft][LoadBatta]
Alright, you louts.[AN]
Hand over yer' treasure and I[N]
won't be havin' to split heads![AN]

[Right]
B-but sir, we have[N]
nothing left to give...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Ya takin' me for a fool?[AN]
I'll teach ya ta mess[N]
with Batta the beast!![AN]

[FarRight]
Eeep!![AN]

[FarFarRight]
Quickly, into[N]
the carriage![AN]

[Right][Clear][FarRight][Clear]

[MidLeft]
Huh?! A wagon?! Blast![AN]
Alright, boys, don't[N]
let them get away![AN]
Burn their little[N]
carriages to ash![A][X]



## Ch5OP3
[MidRight][LoadSanders][MidLeft][LoadMoustacheVillager]
Eh? Who are you?[AN]
Are you here[N]
to help us out?[AN]

[MidRight]
Help you out...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
We're trying to escort the[N]
villagers in our wagons, here.[AN]
But we're not much for fightin'.[AN]
You fellas, on the other hand,[N]
seem capable. What do ya say?[AN]

[MidRight]
We're going to be fighting[N]
these bandits anyways.[AN]
I have no problem with it.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thank you, sir! We just need to[N]
carry them to the gates here.[AN]
The road will lead them to safety.[A][X]



## Ch5Turn1Event
[MidLeft][LoadSanders]
Those must be the wagons.[N]
The gate is behind them.[AN]
If we can [Red]drop [Red]off[N]
the villagers there,[AN]
they can escape.[AN]
Let's try and [Red]rescue[Red][N]
as many as we can.[A][X]



## Ch5Village1
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]
Seems they've already evacuated.[AN]
Oh? They left something here.[N]
Guess nobody will miss it...[A][X]



## Ch5Village2
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]
Looks like the owner and[N]
their things are already gone.[AN]
...But, what's this?[A][X]



## Ch5Village3
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent][MidRight][LoadOldMan]
Oho! Don't worry[N]
about little old me.[AN]
These bones are too weary to[N]
be running around anywho.[AN]
Here. Take this as my way of[N]
saying thanks for the villagers.[A][X]



## Ch5BattaBattle
[MidLeft][LoadBatta]
Like hell I'd let you[N]
punks mess with my messin'![AN]
Bring it on![A][X]

## Ch5BattaDeath
[MidLeft][LoadBatta]
Urgh... no good...[Die][X]

## Ch5ONeillBattle
[MidLeft][LoadONeill]
Think you're tough 'cuz[N]
you got lucky last time?[AN]
I'll teach you[N]
not ta mess wit' us![A][X]

## Ch5ONeillDeath
[MidLeft][LoadONeill]
Just how...[N]
lucky can ya get...?[Die][X]

## Ch5KekhBattle
[MidLeft][LoadKekh]
Ah, you again...[AN]
My blade has hungered[N]
for another bout.[A][X]

## Ch5KekhDeath
[MidLeft][LoadKekh]
Heh, as I expected...[N]
You're pretty tough.[Die][X]



## Ch5Ending
[MidLeft][LoadSanders][Right][LoadFinn][FarRight][LoadOskar]
That the[N]
last of them?[AN]

[Right]
Seems so. Whoever remained[N]
appears to be fleeing.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadWolt]
Should we go[N]
after them?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Let them go.[AN]
Remember why we came[N]
in the first place.[AN]
We still need to[N]
find those sewers.[AN]

[MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadVillagerMan]
The sewers? They're[N]
just over there.[AN]
I'm not sure you'd want to[N]
be heading down there, though.[AN]
They're teeming with monsters.[AN]

[Right]
Thank you for the concern,[N]
but we're aptly prepared.[AN]
Shall we be off, then?[AN]

[Left]
Right.[N]
Let's move.[AN]

[Left][Clear][Right][Clear][FarRight][Clear]
[MidRight][LoadVergil]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Oh, sir Vergil![AN]

[MidRight]
What happened here, citizen?[AN]
I came to investigate the[N]
reports of monster attacks,[AN]
but... I haven't seen so much[N]
as a single soul around town.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well, you see...[A][X]


## Ch5ItemGet
[MidLeft][LoadSanders][MidRight][LoadMoustacheVillager]
Ah, sir![AN]
You were the mercenaries[N]
assisting us, correct?[AN]

[MidLeft]
That'd be us.[AN]

[MidRight]
The villagers asked us to[N]
deliver this to you,[AN]
for helping them escape.[AN]
Please, take it.[A][X]
