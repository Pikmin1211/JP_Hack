## Ch1Name
Chapter 1: Greener Pastures[X]

## Ch1Objective
Defeat Derek[X]




## Ch1OP
[MidRight][LoadArden]
Alright![N]
This way![AN]

[Left][LoadWolt][FarLeft][LoadVillagerMan]
Huff, huff...[N]
Coming![AN]

[Left]
Is this[N]
everyone?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, seems like.[AN]

[MoveRight][FarRight][LoadGreenSoldier]
Sir Arden, they're[N]
gaining on us![AN]

[Right]
Blast. We'll have to[N]
stand our ground then.[AN]
[MoveRight]
Men, at the ready![AN]

[FarRight]
Yes sir![AN]

[Right]
Wolt, I need you direct the[N]
villagers out of here. Got it?[AN]

[Left]
Understood. This[N]
way, you guys![AN]
[Clear]

[FarLeft]
Ah, give me[N]
a moment...[A][X]




## Ch1OP2
[MidLeft][LoadKekh]
You can't run in that[N]
armor forever, worm![AN]

[MidRight][LoadArden]
I don't intend to.[N]
Have at me, scum![AN]

[MidLeft]
Big talk! We'll see how you and your[N]
little men stand up to my blade![AN]
Boys! Get those villagers![N]
Don't let 'em get away![A][X]



## Ch1OP3
[MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier][Right][LoadVergil]
This is the place.[AN]
Men, be ready to search the homes.[N]
Don't let anyone interfere.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes sir![AN]
[Clear]

[FarRight][LoadDerek]
Are you really okay[N]
with this, sir Vergil?[AN]

[Right]
...If I had the option,[N]
I would not do this.[AN]
However, orders are orders.[AN]
As a knight, you must be ready[N]
to do anything for your kingdom.[AN]
Do you understand, Derek?[AN]

[FarRight]
...Yes, I think so.[AN]
Let's proceed, then.[N]
We must find it.[A][X]




## Ch1OP4
[MidLeft][LoadArden]
Imperial soldiers?[AN]
And they don't[N]
look friendly...[AN]
Damn, just my luck...[A][X]




## Ch1OP5
[Right][LoadScott][FarLeft][LoadOskar][Left][LoadFinn][FarRight][LoadSanders]
Looks like we're in for[N]
more than we bargained for.[AN]

[FarLeft]
What a commotion...[AN]

[Right]
Imperial soldiers...?[N]
But what are they doing here?[AN]

[Left]
Does it matter?[AN]
If they get in our way,[AN]
we have no choice[N]
but to eliminate them.[AN]

[Right]
Brigands and bandits[N]
are one thing, but...[AN]

[FarLeft]
If they hurt anybody,[AN]
or any plants, it's[N]
still unforgivable![AN]
Isn't that right?[AN]

[Right]
Yeah, you're[N]
right, Oskar.[AN]

[FarRight]
Then let's move![A][X]




## Ch1VergilLeaves
[FarLeft][LoadDerek][Left][LoadVergil][MidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir Vergil![N]
Urgent news![AN]

[Left]
Speak, soldier.[AN]

[MidRight]
It's those cursed[N]
creatures again, sir.[AN]
They're attacking[N]
one of our forts![AN]
The men won't last[N]
much longer alone.[AN]

[Left]
What?! Blast![N]
I understand.[AN]
I ride to their aide.[AN]
Derek, I'll entrust you[N]
with finishing this task.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Me, sir?[AN]

[Left]
Are you unsure?[AN]

[FarLeft]
...No, it's[N]
an honor, sir.[AN]
You can rely on me.[AN]

[Left]
Excellent. Then I[N]
must make haste.[A][X]



## Ch1VergilLeaves2
[MidRight][LoadDerek]
[Beat][N]
For my kingdom...[A][X]



## Ch1Sayori
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent][MidRight][LoadSayori]
It's rather noisy outside...[N]
Trouble? Oh, my... Here, let me help![AN]
...No, please don't worry about me.[N]
I'm stronger than I look, you know![A][X]



## Ch1SandersWoltTalk
[MidLeft][LoadSanders][MidRight][LoadWolt]
Huh? Hey, who are you?[AN]
You don't look like[N]
bad guys, at least.[AN]

[MidLeft]
The name's Sanders.[N]
I'm something of a mercenary.[AN]
Looks like you have quite[N]
the predicament on your hands.[AN]

[MidRight]
To put it lightly, yeah.[AN]
Here, help me get these[N]
villagers out of here,[AN]
and then we can clean[N]
these guys up together.[AN]
You can count on my bow![A][X]



## Ch1SandersArdenTalk
[MidLeft][LoadSanders][MidRight][LoadArden]
You here to[N]
help us out?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Something[N]
like that.[AN]

[MidRight]
Thanks, mac. Could use[N]
it right about now.[AN]
Keep close, and I'll[N]
deflect blows for you.[A][X]



## Ch1Village
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent][MidRight][LoadGinger]
Are you the ones fending[N]
off all those bandits?[AN]
What? Imperials too?[N]
What has this world come to...?[AN]
Here, take this as thanks.[N]
It was my father's.[AN]
He was a lanceman, but he was[N]
never able to wield this thing.[AN]
Maybe you'll have better luck.[A][X]



## Ch1House
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent][MidRight][LoadOldLady]
They say in the olden days,[AN]
the Demon King resurrected an[N]
army of monsters to attack people.[AN]
I used to say, "what hogwash!",[N]
to all those kinds of old stories.[AN]
But now, there really are[N]
monsters sulking about.[AN]
Be careful out there, kids.[A][X]



## Ch1DerekBattle
[MidLeft][LoadDerek]
I wasn't expecting[N]
reinforcements...[AN]
No matter! I shall[N]
handle you myself![A][X]



## Ch1DerekDeath
[MidLeft][LoadDerek]
It seems I have[N]
underestimated you.[AN]
But, I shall not[N]
fall here! Not yet![A][X]



## Ch1KekhBattle
[MidLeft][LoadKekh]
Now, where to begin...[AN]
How about you?[N]
Are you ready to die?[A][X]



## Ch1KekhDeath
[MidLeft][LoadKekh]
What?! Impossible...![A][X]



## Ch1Ending
[FarRight][LoadFinn][Right][LoadSanders][Left][LoadWolt][FarLeft][LoadArden]
Thanks for[N]
the support.[AN]

[Right]
Just doing[N]
my job.[AN]

[Left]
So what's[N]
next for us?[AN]

[FarLeft]
I'm not sure,[N]
but I don't like the cut[N]
of those imperial's gib...[AN]

[FarRight]
What do you suppose[N]
they were after?[AN]

[FarLeft][Clear][LoadSayori]
If I might interject...[AN]
There's supposedly some kind of[N]
holy weapon at the temple nearby.[AN]
At least, that's how those old[N]
legends around here used to go.[AN]

[Right]
Are you suggesting[N]
they were after it?[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadMarisa]
Heck, if I knew there was some kind[N]
of holy weapon, I'd be after it.[AN]

[Left]
Now that you mention it...[AN]
I overheard one of the knights[N]
saying something about monsters.[AN]

[Right]
Monsters?[AN]

[FarLeft]
If the empire's having[N]
problems with monsters,[AN]
then it'd only make sense[N]
they'd want a holy weapon...[AN]
Right?[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadBlanc]
If that's true, then the[N]
temple could be in danger.[AN]

[FarRight]
Oh, shoot![N]
You're right![AN]

[FarLeft][Clear][LoadArden]
I guess that settles that, then.[AN]
You don't mind if we tag along?[N]
I know one of the priests there.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadRenge]
Yay, more[N]
friends...[AN]

[Right]
Alright,[N]
let's march.[A][X]




## Ch1Ending2
[MidLeft][LoadKekh]
Holy weapon, eh...?[AN]
A blade of that prestiege would be[N]
well used by someone of my caliber...[A][X]



## Ch1GetItem
[MidRight][LoadSanders][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan]
Excuse me, sir! Thank you and[N]
your friends for helping us.[AN]
Heavens know what those barbarians[N]
would have done to my family...[AN]
Please, take this as payment.[N]
It's the least I can offer you.[A][X]
