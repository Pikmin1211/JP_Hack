Sir Derek! The supply caravan[N]
is proceeding as planned.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Good work, soldiers.[AN]
Send out some men to make[N]
sure it arrives safely.[AN]

[FarRight]
Yes, sir![AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
I can't shake[N]
this feeling...[AN]
Someone is approaching.[AN]

[Right]
Someone, sir? Could it be[N]
those mercenaries again?[AN]

[MidLeft]
No, this feels... different.[AN]
I can't describe it,[N]
but they feel... dreadful.[AN]

[Right]
Don't worry, sir Derek.[AN]
Our scouts will report[N]
back if they find anything.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes, I suppose[N]
you're right.[A][X]




## Ch7OP2
[MidLeft][LoadYandahl]
Supply caravans, hm...[A][X]



## Ch7OP3
[MidLeft][LoadSanders][Right][LoadFinn][FarRight][LoadNeptune]
Ahh! Fresh air at last...[AN]
That sewer smell was[N]
starting to get to me...[AN]

[Right]
What should we[N]
do now, Sanders?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I'm not sure.[AN]
We got the second weapon,[AN]
but that's the end of[N]
the line for that lead.[AN]

[FarRight]
What's up with[N]
that guy?[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadYandahl]
Oh, you are...[N]
Sanders, correct?[AN]

[Left]
You know me?[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadBrian]
He must be with[N]
the Basement.[AN]

[Left]
The... what?[AN]

[FarRight]
Oh, have I not told you?[AN]
That's the organization[N]
Eevster is in charge of.[AN]

[Right]
An organization... sounds shady,[AN]
but I suppose that's where[N]
the information comes from.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Indeed I am.[AN]
And on the topic[N]
of information,[AN]
I have some for you.[AN]

[Left]
Go on.[AN]

[FarLeft]
It seems the imperials are moving[N]
a caravan through this valley.[AN]
If you were able to interrupt it...[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadOtaku]
Then we could make[N]
use of their supplies.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Right.[AN]

[Left]
It's not much, but it's a plan.[AN]
We've trusted them before[N]
and it's worked out. Let's go.[A][X]



## Ch7OP4
[MidRight][LoadDerek][MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir! Urgent news![AN]
Our scouts have spotted an armed[N]
group approaching the caravan![AN]

[MidRight]
Blast! Move out whoever is[N]
available, double time![AN]
Prepare units for combat![AN]

[MidLeft]
Sir, yes sir![A][X]




## Ch7Yandahl
[MidLeft][LoadYandahl]
Allow me to accompany you.[AN]
I trust you shall[N]
guide my spear well.[A][X]


## Ch7PostPrep
[MidRight][LoadOtaku]
Looks like they've got more[N]
troops here than I thought...[AN]
No point taking them all on.[AN]
Once we bust those transports[N]
open, [Red]our job here is done[Red].[A][X]



## Ch7WagonEscape
[MidRight][LoadSanders]
Damnit, they[N]
escaped...[A][X]


## Ch7Village
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent][MidRight][LoadKid]
Howdy there! Sorry, but ma[N]
and pa aren't here right now...[AN]
Say, do you want this stuff?[AN]
I found it by the beach and[N]
thought it looked real shiny,[AN]
but I think I'm a-a...[.....][N]
[MoveMidRight]ACHOO![AN]
Allergic...[A][X]



## Ch7SchezoAppears
[MidLeft][LoadSchezo]
[Beat][AN]
Arise, my knights...[N]
Kill... Kill...!![A][X]

## Ch7SchezoAppears2
[MidRight][LoadDerek]
That prescence...[N]
Who is that man?[AN]
I tremble just[N]
looking at him...[A][X]



## Ch7DerekBattle
[MidLeft][LoadDerek]
You would come so far?[AN]
I shall defend the[N]
checkpoint from you, then![A][X]

## Ch7DerekDeath
[MidLeft][LoadDerek]
As expected of...[N]
your strength...[A][X]

## Ch7SchezoBattle
[MidLeft][LoadSchezo]
[Beat][N]
Destroy![A][X]

## Ch7SchezoDeath
[MidLeft][LoadSchezo]
This is...[N]
Meaningless...[A][X]



## Ch7Ending
[MidLeft][LoadSanders][FarRight][LoadYandahl][Right][LoadMarisa]
Phew! Okay![AN]
That's the last of[N]
the wagons, I think![AN]

[MidLeft]
Then let's leave before[N]
we get overwhelmed.[AN]

[FarRight]
We have a camp up[N]
to the north.[AN]
You are more than[N]
welcome to rest there.[AN]

[MidLeft]
That works for me. But isn't[N]
the path north blocked?[AN]

[FarRight]
There are many paths up[N]
the mountains. Follow me.[A][X]



## Ch7Ending2
[MidLeft][LoadSchezo][MidRight][LoadDerek]
You... what[N]
are you...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
[Beat][N]
Kill...[AN]

[MidRight]
Can he even[N]
understand me?[AN]

[MoveRight][FarRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir, he's slaughtering our men![N]
I need orders, and quickly![AN]

[Right]
Gah! Full retreat![N]
I'll hold him off![AN]

[FarRight]
Yes sir![AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft][MoveLeft]
You are...[N]
finished!![AN]

[Right]
Grrr![A][X]
